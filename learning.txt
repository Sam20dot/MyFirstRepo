thank you in this course i have  learnt the way control version work and i have seen the different ways this works 
so far i have studied to make repasitory ,to fork , and to make the branch as we have studied them in this courses 
anathor interesting things is that we have studied to clone the files or repasitory where you can work on them on 
your own computer when you finish you can push them to the main and also i have studied to collaborates with others 
so this knonledges is more important in my academic journey it so amazing
